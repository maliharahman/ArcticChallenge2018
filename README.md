# ArcticChallenge2018
Hackathon (NOVEMBER 30 - DEC 2, 2018) Skelleftea, Sweden
Team name- Arctic Shakers

Problem Description:

Air pollution

Use data from the air quality sensors of SSR/SSiO. 
Make a dynamic map where the air pollution is presented in different colours. 
Extrapolate to get continuous values.

Make it possible to also connect future sensors, 
and also a functionality to simulate more sensors, 
e.g. by time-shifting an existing sensor's data to another location.
Show both NOx and particles.

If there is time, 
also make a presentation on mobiles where you see the map in horizontal mode,
and a superposed presentation on the camera's image in vertical mode.
